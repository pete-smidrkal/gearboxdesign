      <h1>T&T APP</h1>
      <h2 class="projectheading">THE APP</h2>
      <img class="projectimage3" src="../img/tandt/profiletandt.png" alt="UI project" title="UI project">
      <p class="paragraph2">Training and Therapies is a platform that connects professionals in the wellbeing sector with clients. Users can book different wellbeing services in just a few clicks. Services are delivered to clients homes - or any other preferred location - to provide maximum convenience.</p>
<h2 class="projectheading">DEVELOPMENT</h2>
<p class="paragraph2">The app aesthetics was intended to be minimalist, clean and clear in order to make users  feel at ease and confident going through all stages of the booking process. No design elements like shapes or textures were to be present.</p>
<h2 class="projectheading">MOOD BOARD</h2>
<img class="projectimage3" src="../img/tandt/moodboardtandt.jpg" alt="UI project" title="UI project">
<p class="paragraph2">
Clear, Fresh and Natural: The inspiration was fresh water and food, and outdoor living. This mood board wants to demonstrate that healthy people is empowered to achieve anything they want because they are not held back by an unhealthy body or mind.</p>
<h2 class="projectheading">THE COLORS</h2>
<img class="projectimage3" src="../img/tandt/colorstandt.jpg" alt="UI project" title="UI project">
<h2 class="projectheading">LOGO</h2>
<img class="projectimage4" src="../img/tandt/logotandt.jpg" alt="UI project" title="UI project">
<p class="paragraph2">In designing the logo the intention was to immediately demonstrate health and wellbeing while maintaining simplicity. Browsing through hundreds of images which represented health and wellbeing the image of a healthy looking heart, inspired by the logo of the British Heart Foundation, became the idea to develop and it took form after a few sketches.</p>
<h2 class="projectheading">TYPOGRAPHY</h2>
<p class="paragraph2">A single font for the entire app was favoured in order to keep a simple style. San-serif Montserrat was elected for it's slick and clear aesthetics. Only light weights are used in both headlines and copy keeping differences subtle.</p>
<h2 class="projectheading">IMAGERY</h2>
<img class="projectimage3" src="../img/tandt/imagery.jpg" alt="UI project" title="UI project">
<p class="paragraph2">To add a bit of human warmth and colour, imagery of healthy happy people is used. In order to make all of the photographs look and feel consistent with one another a filter was applied on top of them. However, they were kept light, perfectly colored, and not overly saturated.</p>
